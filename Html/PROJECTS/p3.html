    <h1>YELLOW BIRCH</h1>
    <p>Yellow birch is an important and prominent timber tree of New York State. It is common throughout the state, except on Long Island, on rich, moist uplands in company with beech and sugar maple, but is found also with red spruce in the swamps and along waterways. The heavy, very strong, hard, close-grained, light brown wood is largely used for furniture, woodenware, flooring, interior finish, airplanes, and agricultural implements. Its value for fuelwood entitles it to a place in farmers' woodlots. Its seeds often sprout and grow from the tops of rotten stumps and logs.

    <h1>AMERICAN HOPHORNBEAM</h1>
    <p>merican hophornbeam is closely related to the American hornbeam and is rather generally distributed throughout New York State on dry, gravelly, and stony soils of slopes and ridges, sometimes taking possession of woodlots in central New York to the exclusion of other species. The tree is slow-growing and is rarely found larger than 10 inches in diameter. The wood is very heavy, hard, and strong, hence the name "ironwood." It is used for tool and implement handles and for levers, and makes excellent fuelwood when seasoned.

    <h1>SHADBUSH</h1>
    <p>Shadbush is an attractive tree though not of value for timber because of its small size. In the spring when the shad are ascending the rivers, its small white flowers are commonly noticed along the drier banks of the streams, along fence rows, and on hillsides in open woods. It is common throughout most parts of the state, particularly in the central and southern highlands. Its wood is heavy, harder than white oak, strong, close-grained, and dark brown in color often tinged with red. It is occasionally used for tool handles and is highest of all native woods in heat value.</p>
